# StarkNext

StarkNext is a quick-start template designed to help you build decentralized applications (DApps) on Starknet using Next.js and Jotai.

Starknet is a decentralized, permissionless and scalable zkRollup, while Next.js is a popular React framework with built-in features like server-side rendering and static site generation. Jotai provides minimalistic state management for your React app, making state logic simple and intuitive.

This starter also includes functionality for Starknet wallet connections, so you can focus on building your DApp without the hassle of setting up these connections from scratch.

## Features

- **Custom Wallet Modal**: Built on top of _get-starknet-core_, StarkNext allows you to implement your own custom wallet modal, giving you more control over the user experience than ever before.

- **Integrated StarkNet Wallet Connection**: To save you the trouble of setting up wallet connections from scratch, StarkNext pre-configures these connections. You can connect to StarkNet wallets seamlessly, allowing you to focus more on building the unique aspects of your DApp.

## Technologies

StarkNext is built using a stack of powerful technologies each chosen to provide you the best tools for DApp development:

- **Next.js**: A versatile framework for building React applications. With built-in features like server-side rendering and static site generation, Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production. See the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information.

- **Jotai**: Minimalistic state management for React. Jotai provides the simplest way to manage state, reducing complexity while maintaining optimal performance for your application. See the [Jotai documentation](https://jotai.org/docs/introduction) for more information.

- **StarkNet**: As a decentralized, permissionless and scalable zkRollup, StarkNet provides a secure and efficient layer 2 scaling solution, making your DApp more performant and cost-effective. See the [StarkNet documentation](https://docs.starknet.io/) for more information.
